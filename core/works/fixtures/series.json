(It's actually a fix-up novel comprised of her two Pern novellas with additional material added.) The sequels were added later. Numbers 2 and 3, Dragonquest and The White Dragon were written later. A decade later in the case of the latter. The White Dragon can be read as a standalone. (But it's better as the third in the series.)\"",

The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\n    \n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological order:\n    \n        Taltos (1988)\n        Dragon (1998)\n        Yendi (1984)\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\n        Jhereg (1983)\n        Teckla (1987)\n        Phoenix (1990)\n        Jhegaala (2008)\n        Athyra (1993)\n        Orca (1996)\n        Issola (2001)\n        Dzur (2006)\n        Tiassa, section 2 (2011)\n        Iorich (2010)\n        Tiassa, section 3 (2011)\n    \n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Brust\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/Vlad",
