            "about": "Douglas No\u00ebl Adams was an English author, comic radio dramatist, and musician. He is best known as the author of the <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy\" title=\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>\n</i> series. Hitchhiker's began on radio, and developed into a \"trilogy\" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a television series, a comic book series, a computer game, and a feature film that was completed after Adams' death. The series has also been adapted for live theatre using various scripts; the earliest such productions used material newly written by Adams. He was known to some fans as Bop Ad (after his illegible signature), or by his initials \"DNA\".<br /><br />In addition to <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series Doctor Who and served as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the Dirk Gently novels, and he co-wrote two Liff books and <i>Last Chance to See</i>, itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game <i>Starship Titanic</i>, which was produced by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by Terry Jones. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359.The_Salmon_of_Doubt\" title=\"The Salmon of Doubt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Salmon of Doubt</a>\n</i> in 2002.<br /><br />His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the Macintosh computer, and other \"techno gizmos\". <br /><br />Toward the end of his life he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment.",

            "about": "William McGuire \"Bill\" Bryson, OBE, FRS was born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1951. He settled in England in 1977, and worked in journalism until he became a full time writer. He lived for many years with his English wife and four children in North Yorkshire. He and his family then moved to New Hampshire in America for a few years, but they have now returned to live in the UK.<br /><br />In <i>The Lost Continent</i>, Bill Bryson's hilarious first travel book, he chronicled a trip in his mother's Chevy around small town America. It was followed by <i>Neither Here Nor There</i>, an account of his first trip around Europe. Other travel books include the massive bestseller <i>Notes From a Small Island</i>, which won the 2003 World Book Day National Poll to find the book which best represented modern England, followed by <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> (in which Stephen Katz, his travel companion from <i>Neither Here Nor There</i>, made a welcome reappearance), <i>Notes From a Big Country</i> and <i>Down Under</i>.<br /><br />Bill Bryson has also written several highly praised books on the English language, including <i>Mother Tongue</i> and <i>Made in America</i>. In his last book, he turned his attention to science. <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> was lauded with critical acclaim, and became a huge bestseller. It was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize, before going on to win the Aventis Prize for Science Books and the Descartes Science Communication Prize. His next book, <i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</i>, is a memoir of growing up in 1950s America, featuring another appearance from his old friend Stephen Katz. October 8 sees the publication of <i>A Really Short History of Nearly Everything<i>.</i></i>",
